# simulated-image-signal-pipeline
A simulation of low-level image processing is performed using MATLAB Simulink, demonstrating how an image processing pipeline can be implemented in a modern digital camera.

# How to?
1. Clone the repo
2. run do.m file(preapres an environment variable for simulation)
3. open rawread_slx.slx(this is the simulation file) & run the simulation(user can choose what to process and what display by simply comment function)

# Note
Tested with Matlab version 2022b and later
